                <h2>Math in Early Life to Now</h2>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>When I first had my intro to mathematics, I thought it was just a tool to use. 
                    Something that I had to learn to get through school. 
                    I didn't enjoy math in my early years, as memorising basic actions, formulas and equations was tedious and boring. 
                    Most of the time, I saw very minimal practical use. 
                    Over time, I developed an interest in computer science and physics. 
                    I became aware of the links between these two subjects and mathematics. 
                    Math helped solve both difficulties and come up with solutions. 
                    Because I was interested in physics and computer science, I did math and calculus in high school. 
                    Over time, I started to enjoy math bit by bit as I saw the use cases and applications of math in my two favourite fields. 
                    I could also connect mathematics to my hobbies, such as 3D animation and water polo, and the world around me.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Math has now developed into the field of study that I enjoy, and I have begun to appreciate the interesting and cool phenomenon of mathematics.</p>

                    <p>In this presentation, I will be going over some of the applications of math that I have encountered in my life and how they have shaped my understanding of the world around me.</p>
                    <p>I will explore how math has shaped my life and continues to shape my understanding of the world and fascinate me.</p>

                    <h2>Water polo</h2>
                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Water polo is a sport that I have previously played competitively for many years. The sport is a combination of swimming, ball handling, and teamwork. It is very similar to soccer but in water. </p>
                        <p>Water polo is a sport that requires a lot of practice, mental planning, team play, and, more importantly, math, from calculating angles to estimating distances.</p>
                        <p>When playing I have to make sure I understand and are able to estimate the speed and trajectory of the ball using it's vectors to ensure that it goes into the goal.
                        This requires a good understanding of both physics and mathematics.</p>
                        <p>For example, when shooting the ball, I must calculate the angles and distances to the goal. This requires a good understanding of both trigonometry and geometry.</p>
                        <p>This is especially important due to the interactions between the ball and the water. In the 3D-rendered image example, a shot with a spin bounces off the water and changes its direction rapidly.</p>

                <h3>Example - Trigonometric Ratios</h3>
                <p>One of the many applications of mathematics that I use during coding is trigonometry. In this example code I wrote, an image is dynamically resized based on the size of the window it is in, using trigonometric ratios.</p>

                <p> Throughout my coding journey, I have encountered various applications of mathematics. Whether that is matrix addition, vectors, imaginary number (usally in the form of quaterion versors), or even basic integration, I enjoyed learning how to apply mathematics and code to solve complex problems and applications. Mathematics has always been <i>integral</i> to my coding experience.</p>

                <h2>Animation</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>
                    One of the more interesting applications of mathematics I use is in 3D animation.<br>
                    Using trigonometric functions, such as sine waves or quadratic functions, to create smooth and precise animations is an excellent example of how I use math when doing 3D animation and rendering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Furthermore, one of my favourite things to use math for is texturing.<br>
                    Various noise functions (such as Perlin and Voronoi) are used with multiple mathematical functions (such as range and multiplication) to adjust and manipulate noise during the texturing process.<br>
                    I can then use mathematical processes to map these textures to objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Additionally, I use math to accurately position and rotate objects in 3D space, done using matrices and vectors;<br>
                    by applying transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling, I can create 3D models and animations that are visually appealing and realistic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I made an example animation about a game my friends and I played called REPO to show the math involved in the animation.

                    <p>Multiple processes are happening in the images above.</p>
                    <p>First I am taking the objects 3d faces coordinates and mapping them to a 2d space (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping">UV map</a>) so that the texture can be applied to it accurately.</p>
                    <p>Then I am using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">fractal perlin noise</a> function to create a base texture, and then using a variety of math functions to manipulate the noise to create the final texture.</p>
                    <p>The math functions I use for this are either done though a standard mathematical node that can run, an operation function, a comparision, a rounding function, or a trigonometric function.
                    I also commonly use a color ramp as a function for mapping values, where 0 is black and 1 is white.
                    Using a coloramp makes visualing mathematical much easier and allows for easier modification of functions.
                    It also also useful for mapping the mathematical functions into visual elements for the texture.</p>
                    <p>I don't always use a perlin noise function, I might use a type of graident function, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">voronoi function</a>, or a banded wave fuction(such as sine, cosine, or tangent).</p>
                    <p>Additionally pre-made images can be used in conjunction to make materials, as seen in the globe texture.</p>
                    <p>These functions together are used to create a variety of textures and materials.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>One of my favorite mathematical phenomenon, that combines both my love of physics with mathematics, is the collisions of two blocks calculating the digits of &pi;.</p>
                    <p>See the interactive demo below to understand how the number of collisions between two blocks— differing in mass by a factor of 100— reveals the digits of &pi;. 
                    The demo uses a simple physics engine to simulate the motion of the blocks and their interactions.</p>

                    <p>This naturally occuring phenomenon is a great example of how math and physics in nature create unusual and fascinating results.</p>
                    <p>At first I didn't understand how this was possible, it made no sense to me why something semingly unrelated to &pi;, would have some connection, let alone represent digits of &pi;. 
                    However after looking for the solution, I could understand the connection when displaying calculating their momentum and thought that it was quite facinating.</p>
                    <p> The blocks are set in motion, and as they collide, they transfer energy and momentum. The number of collisions between the two blocks is directly related to the digits of &pi;. 
                    This is because the formula for energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$, or more the conservation of energy between the two block $\frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^{2}=constant$, forms a circle when graphed substituting in x and y.</p>
                    <p>Mathematical phenomena like this truly fascinates me. They capture my attention in a way few other subjects do. Discovering unique and intriguing patterns in math has become one of the key reasons I've grown to genuinely enjoy the subject.</p>

                <p>Mathematics has been crucial in not only my educational experince but my life overall. Mathematics impacts me and plays a key role in my studies, hobbies, and overall view of the world.</p>
                <p>From the simple math of water-polo to the complex math of 3D animation, I have learned to appreciate mathematics and its intricacies. </p>
                <p>Math, for me, has evolved from just a tool to use, another thing to remeber and deal with, to a way of thinking and understanding the world.
                It is a language that can be used to describe and explain the world around us, but also to fuel curiosity and wonder, at least for me personally.
                I have learned to appreciate the intricacies and complexity of mathematics, and enjoy how it can be used to solve problems and create solutions.</p>
                <p>I may still sturggle in some areas of mathematics, but I have learned to embrace the challenges, and stive to improve and understand and enjoy the process of learning along the way.</p>
